# Zocket Assignment

The solution for the Assignment Task 1 in the form of a REST API. The API is also documented using Postman and the collection can be accessed using the button below.

Moreover, I have provided a frontend using server-side rendering for the Assignment Task 2. I have also provided `sample CSV files` for the frontend below.

Both the frontend and the API are hosted on Railway.
